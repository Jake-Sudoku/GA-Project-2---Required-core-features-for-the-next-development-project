## Project Description

The project was built as part of General Assembly's requirement to pass the course. The project aims to find out what is required core features for the next development project to increase the sales price. To do that, my team has cleaned the data, analyze the features, trained the model till an accuracy of 81%.

## Background

Real Sky Estate Development has been developing residential areas around Ames and is looking to procure and develop new housing in the area. 

Previous housing developments were not returning favorable profits due to the recent pandemic and political tensions. It also caused a rise in the costs of living and building materials over the years.

Facing a forecasted recession in the upcoming year, Real Sky senior management team has reached out to our data science team to pinpoint factors that will direct towards revamping the companyâ€™s focus structure to improve the attractiveness and sales price of new housing developments.

## Problem Statement

What core features should we, Real Sky, focus on to increase the sale price of homes for our next development project?

---

## Assumptions

The following are the assumptions made:
- Only features with metrics correlation >0.6 with reference to sale price are considered for the analysis
- Time constraint for the project
- Only select features with less than 5% missing data
- Missing data are replaced with median values of the features ([*source*](https://www.mastersindatascience.org/learning/how-to-deal-with-missing-data/))

## Data Import & Cleaning

#### Datasets

There are 2 datasets are used. The below are the 2 datasets :

* [`Train.csv`](./data/Train.csv): Train score for model
* [`Test.csv`](./data/Test.csv): Test score for model

The below are the steps that was done for data import and cleaning:
- create functions for cleaning;
- import libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, shapy, sklearn , Image, warnings, scipy and seaborn;
- cleaning the data such as converting dictionary to dataframe, remove duplicates, check and remove missing values, convert values format into suitable format, convert ordinal to values, replace missing values with median,rename headings and remove data not used for analysis;

#### Data dictionary

|Feature|Type|Dataset|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|**saleprice**|int64|Train|The sale price of the house.| 
|**garage area**|int64|Train & Test|The size of garage in square feet.| 
|**gr liv area**|int64|Train & Test|Above grade (ground) living area square feet.| 
|**1st flr sf**|int64|Train & Test|First Floor square feet.| 
|**total bsmt sf**|int64|Train & Test|Total square feet of basement area.| 
|**bsmt qual**|int64|Train & Test|Evaluates the height of the basement.| 
|**exter qual**|int64|Train & Test|Evaluates the quality of the material on the exterior.| 
|**overall qual**|int64|Train & Test|Rates the overall material and finish of the house.|

## Exploratory Data Analysis

From the Data Analysis, I have found out the core features that contributed to the sales prices are :
- overall qual 
- exter qual       
- bsmt qual        
- total bsmt sf    
- 1st flr sf       
- gr liv area      
- garage area

## Data Visualization

The following are the visualization done:
- Triangle Heatmap
- Triangle Pair Gird
- Histogram
- Boxplot
- Bar plot
- Variable Importance Plot
- Shapley value plot

---

## Conclusions & Recommendations

The key takeaway is that with my model,which has a 81% accuracy ,have identified 7 top core features that will greatly affect the sales price and we should place our focus on these features for the next development.

Therefore, I recommend that we can have a greater budget allocation and maketing on the core features.

In the future, I hope that I can implement features such as forecasting sales price using of machine learning.
